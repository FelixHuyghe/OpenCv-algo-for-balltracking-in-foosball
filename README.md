# Balltracking algorithm for foosball-tables

Algorithm that tracks the ball in footage of foosball games. The algorithm works by using a color-filter to segment the orange ball in each frame.
The algorithm reached an impressive score of about 97% recall and precision on our dataset.
This was part of my bachelor's thesis in which this algorithm was used as a baseline to benchamrk a deep learning approach.
